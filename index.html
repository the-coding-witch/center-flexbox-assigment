                When I was 5 years old, my dad brought home a cartridge computer for my sister and me to play games on. I played Frogger on that computer every day and that's when my obsession with gaming started. Years later, we got a Tandy 1000, and I was introduced to a game which allowed you to create stories, add very pixelated images, and customize the color scheme. That's when I realized that I loved manipulating computers.

                In middle school, I enrolled in a typing class. That's when I discovered that my years playing King's Quest and story creation games had made me an incredibly fast typer. I was the best student in the class and my teacher was continuously praising me for my skills. 
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                As an adult, I've had many office jobs where typing was the main focus. Now I'm taking all my skills and experience with computers to the next level. Learning to code has been an exciting and fulfilling experience, and I can't wait to get paid to do it every day!
